SQL
SQL tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of SQL. Our SQL tutorial is designed for both beginners and professionals.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database, such as updating records, inserting records, deleting records, creating and modifying database tables, views, etc.

SQL is not a database system, but it is a query language.

Suppose you want to perform the queries of SQL language on the stored data in the database. You are required to install any database management system in your systems

Structured Query Language contains the following four components in its process:

Query Dispatcher
Optimization Engines
Classic Query Engine
SQL Query Engine, etc.

The SQL commands help in creating and managing the database. The most common SQL commands which are highly used are mentioned below:

CREATE command
UPDATE command
DELETE command
SELECT command
DROP command
INSERT command

Consider following relational schema and write the relational algebra expressions for given queries.
Sailors(sid: integer, sname: string, rating: integer, age: real);
Boats(bid: integer, bname: string, color: string);
Reserves(sid: integer, bid: integer, day: date).

2. Find the names of sailors who have never reserved boat number 103.
The SQL IN condition (sometimes called the IN operator) allows you to easily check whether any value in a value list Matches an expression. It is used in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement to help reduce the need for multiple OR conditions.

The SQL NOT IN condition (sometimes called the IN operator) allows you to easily check whether any value in a value list NOT Matches an expression. It is used in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement to help reduce the need for multiple OR conditions.

select s.sname
from sailors s
where s.sid not in (select r.sid from reserves rwhere r.bid=103);
 
Output:
SNAME

5. Find the names of sailors who have reserved both a red and a green boat?
The SQL INTERSECT operator is used to return 2 or more SELECT statements resulting. It only returns the rows selected from all queries or data sets, though. If a record occurs in one question and not in the other, the INTERSECT results will omit the record.


SQL> select s.sid,s.sname
  2  from sailors s,boats b,reserves r
  3  where s.sid=r.sid and b.bid=r.bid and b.color='red'
  4  INTERSECT

 6. Find the names of sailors who have reserved a red but not a green boat?
The SQL MINUS operator is used to return all the rows which are not returned by the second SELECT statement in the first SELECT statement. Each SELECT declaration describes a dataset. The MINUS operator must extract all records from the first dataset, then delete all records from the second dataset from the test.

Oracle does not have EXCEPT but use keyword MINUS.
select s.sid,s.sname
from sailors s,boats b,reserves r
where s.sid=r.sid and b.bid=r.bid and b.color='red'
MINUS
select s.sid,s.sname
from sailors s,boats b,reserves r
where s.sid=r.sid and b.bid=r.bid and b.color='green';
 
       SID SNAME
